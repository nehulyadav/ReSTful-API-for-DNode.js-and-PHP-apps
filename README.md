# A ReSTful API for DNode.js and PHP apps

REST, or in the full form, Representational State Transfer has become the standard design architecture for developing web APIs. At its heart REST is a stateless client-server relationship; this means that unlike many other approaches there is no client context being stored server side (no Sessions). To counteract that, each request contains all the information necessary for the server to authenticate the user, and any session state data that must be sent as well.


TO WATCH OUT FOR IN MY REPOSITORY:
I am also building a ReST API powered by Angular JS in the front end and Laravel in the backend in a full fledged Model-View Controller architecture in JSON data format.
