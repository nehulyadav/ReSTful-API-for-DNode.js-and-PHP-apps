# A ReSTful API for DNode.js and PHP apps

What does it represent in simple terms?
REST, or in the full form, Representational State Transfer has become the standard design architecture for developing web APIs. At its heart REST is a stateless client-server relationship; this means that unlike many other approaches there is no client context being stored server side (no Sessions). To counteract that, each request contains all the information necessary for the server to authenticate the user, and any session state data that must be sent as well.

How it Works?

Each request contains all the information necessary for the server to authenticate the user including session state data that must be sent as well. REST takes advantage of the HTTP request methods to layer itself into the existing HTTP architecture. By creating URI endpoints that utilize these operations, a RESTful API is quickly assembled.


I am currently working on another Form Of ReST using Angular JS and Laravel- micro PHP framework: <br>

A ReST API powered by Angular JS in the front end and Laravel in the backend in a full fledged Model-View Controller architecture in data exchange in modals of JSON object.
